- Hi! My name is Tyler (@Ty1776). I am a software developer, manager, salesman, and gamer. Prior to software development I served for 6 years in the United States Air Force and then spent over 9 years as an HVAC technician repairing and maintaining heating equipment, building great relationships with my clients, and managing large projects that I had sold. I have a strong attention to detail I try to live by the values: integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all I do. I have a strong foundation for software development and a specialty in Python. I plan on applying these learned skills as part of a team, building products (or games) that may bring joy to people of all ages, for generations to come. As a gamer, my ultimate goal is to be a part of a team in the gaming industry in a sales and marketing capacity. 
- Full-Stack Software Developer. Python, Pygame, Next.js, React.js, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, NoSQL, Axios, Express, Git
